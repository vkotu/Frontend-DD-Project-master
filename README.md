## Hi  

## Getting started
This is a simple chat application provides users to login and chat acroos the rooms. For sake of easy access i deployed the app in heroku.
Here is the link for it to test the application `https://piscine-fromage-68806.herokuapp.com/` .
Please email me kotu.js@gmail.com in case you do not see the link working. I will try to fix it ASAP.

### 1. Installing minimum deps
Make sure you have `node` installed, with a version greater than `7.0.0`. I highly recommend [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), or just installing the latest version of `node` with `brew install node` on macOS.

Once you have a good `node` installed, run `npm install` in this repo to get your dependencies.

### 2. Serving your app
By default, you can run `npm start` to run your app.

### 3. Open
Once the server started you can visit http://localhost:8000/ and test the application.
