## Hi  

## Getting started
This is a simple chat application, which provides the ability for the users to login and chat in the available rooms/channels. For sake of easy access i deployed the app in heroku.
Here is the link for it https://piscine-fromage-68806.herokuapp.com/ .
Please email me kotu.js@gmail.com in case you do not see the link working. I will try to fix it ASAP.

### 1. Installing minimum deps
Internet connection :)

Please clone the repo `git@gitlab.com:vkotu/Frontend-DD-Project-master.git`, go in to the directory the repo is cloned.

Make sure you have `node` installed, with a version greater than `7.0.0`. I highly recommend [`nvm`](https://github.com/creationix/nvm), or just installing the latest version of `node` with `brew install node` on macOS.

Once you have a good `node` installed, run `npm install` in this repo to get your dependencies.

### 2. Serving your app
By default, you can run `npm start` to run your app.

### 3. Open
Once the server started you can visit http://localhost:8000/ and test the application.

### 4. Notes

1. I used socket.io to acheive this,There is an open use https://github.com/socketio/socket.io/issues/3259 occuring in **chrome**  while sitting idle. I have faced this multliple times while developing this. So please note this and if possible test this in mozilla as i did not see any isse while testing in mozilla.
